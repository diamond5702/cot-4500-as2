Assignment 2

In this assignment, we will be using python to approximate points on curve using data sets.

To compile you will need to have python installed as well as numpy. 
You can do this by opening your command prompt and typing in:

pip install numpy

After that, to run the code you will need to change the directory to the folder where the file was downloaded. 
  Ex: If the file was dowloaded to the "Downloads" folder you'd type:

cd Downloads

Lastly to run the code, type:

python3 assignment_2.py
